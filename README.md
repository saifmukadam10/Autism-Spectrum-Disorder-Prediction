# Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Prediction
This project develops a deep learning-based screening tool for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a novel dataset containing 20 featuresâ€”10 behavioural traits (AQ-10-Adult) and 10 individual characteristics. By leveraging state-of-the-art neural network models, the tool aims to provide a cost-effective preliminary screening method.
